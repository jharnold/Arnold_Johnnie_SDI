//Conditional Logic

var kidHeight = 47;
var minHeight = 48;
var sneakerLift = 2;

//if child is old enough print to console "You can ride!"
//if kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight + sneakerLift > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
