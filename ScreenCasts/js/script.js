//Conditional Logic

var kidHeight = 52;
var minHeight = 48;


//if child is old enough print to console "You can ride!"
//if kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
} else {
    console.log("Sorry kiddo");
}
